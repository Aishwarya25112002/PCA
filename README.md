# PCA
PCA is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional datasets.
It identifies the principal components, which are orthogonal vectors that capture the maximum variance in the data.
These components are ordered by the amount of variance they explain, allowing for data compression while preserving essential information.
PCA is widely used in various fields, including image processing, finance, and genetics, for feature extraction and visualization.
